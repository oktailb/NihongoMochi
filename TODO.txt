Objectif:
La meilleure appli d apprentissage du japonais qui soit


Features:
 - Grammar section with typical JLTP exercises
   - fill exercices database
 - Prévoir l'intégration "Social" (comparaison de progression) pour plus tard.
   - reussir la connexion au google play !
 - Du son ! Du bruit ! des effets !

Games:
  - memorize: hidden card pairs -> retrieve couples, different modes -> kanji/kanji kanji/meaning kanji/reading reading/meaning
  - Simon : enforce kanji remembering by sequence
  - Taquin : redo the basic gojuon table hiragana/katakana [DONE]
  - Tetris/Candycrush like (Kana Drop) : achieve words from selected level in Kana to make blocks disappear
  - Crosswords (Mochi-Cross) : crossword generator using JLPT vocabulary
  - Particle Defender : shooter grammatical pour automatiser le choix des particules (wa, ga, ni, o...)
  - Radical Forge : puzzle de construction de Kanji à partir de leurs radicaux
  - Shiritori Zen : jeu de chaîne de mots traditionnel japonais contre l'IA
  - Shadow Kanji : identification de Kanjis par leur silhouette ou tracé flou

Notes on iOS port::
I dont have relevat mac means to achievei it localy
Advices get :
That is a common hurdle for older Mac hardware. Since Xcode is mandatory for compiling the Kotlin/Native code into an iOS framework and for linking the final app, you have a few options to proceed without buying a new Mac:
1. The "Power User" Solution: OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP)
If your iMac is technically capable but "retired" by Apple, you can use OpenCore Legacy Patcher to install a newer version of macOS (like Sonoma or Sequoia) on unsupported hardware.
• Why do this? It will allow you to install the latest Xcode and build your app locally. Many developers use this to keep 2015–2017 iMacs/MacBooks relevant for development.
• Risk: It's a third-party patch; it's generally stable but can have minor issues with sleep or specific graphics drivers.
2. The "Cloud" Solution: GitHub Actions
You can continue developing the shared logic and UI in Android Studio on your current macOS. To actually "see" it on iOS:
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Set up a GitHub Action using a macos-latest runner (which has the latest Xcode).
3. The Action can build the .ipa file for you or run your tests.
4. You can use a service like Appetize.io to upload the build and view it in a browser-based iOS simulator.
3. Build the iOS Structure Anyway
Even if you can't run it locally yet, you can prepare the project so it's "ready to go" once you have access to a newer environment (or OCLP).
I can help you create the necessary iosMain bridge files right now. This will make your shared module technically "Multiplatform" even if your local machine can't finish the final compilation.
Would you like me to generate the iosMain source files and update your build.gradle.kts to ensure the structure is correct? (This won't require Xcode to just write the code).
=====> looks complicated for few advantages ---> may we consider a web version ?
